### Member Features - SE Returns

The SE Returns page give a comprehensive list of all the SE Returns associated to the member. MemberCRM displays returns in their different states, allowing a user to quickly view what returns are open, being edited, or have been finalised and paid out. Users are also able to create new SE Returns, or view the SE Returns more in depth, and view any invoices and receipts linked to the return.
