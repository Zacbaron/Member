### Company / Member Search

MemberCRM features a universal search bar for both members and companies. A user is able to enter in any information regarding a member or company, for instance a postal address or their ID number, to be able to search for the specific company or member.
The Search page also displays recently accessed members/companies for quick access through the system, without having to search for the member or company again. The recently accessed sidebar can also be extended to show up to 20 results.
The Company search can also be configured to search for company contacts as well, allowing for more precise searching.
