### Operations

The Operations dashboard is a hub for users to be able to move between MemberCRMâ€™s different reviewing and processing tasks, such as New companies, new entitlements, refunds, new members and more.
The page also gives access to the batch jobs for MemberCRM. This allows users to view all the batch tasks that MemberCRM generates.
