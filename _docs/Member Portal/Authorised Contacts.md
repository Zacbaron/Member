Authorised Contacts

MemberCRM has the feature of giving a member the option to create contacts for their account. This lets users have family members or business representatives associated to the account to allow them to receive the benefits in their stead, or have emergency contacts. This feature can be greatly customised to allow anyone to be a beneficiary, have portal access, or only allow them to be an active contact for a specified amount of time.

MemberCRM also keeps an audit of all members, current and archived, in a list for viewing at any time.
